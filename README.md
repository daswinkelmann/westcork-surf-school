## Responsiveness

**SurfsUp** is fully responsive across all screen sizes, thanks to **Bootstrap‚Äôs grid system**. The layout adapts smoothly from desktop to mobile, ensuring a clean and enjoyable experience whether users are booking surf lessons on their laptop or browsing on the beach from their phone.

---

## Colour Palette

The colour palette for **SurfsUp** was chosen to evoke feelings of **freshness, fun**, and the natural world of **surf, sea, sand, and sun**. The tones are light and vibrant, aiming to reflect the easy-going, welcoming vibe of coastal life while still ensuring clarity and accessibility.

The primary colours take inspiration directly from the ocean, offering a mix of calming blues and energising yellows. Special attention was given to contrast and visual harmony, ensuring combinations remain accessible and legible across devices.

| Colour Name       | Hex Code   | Description                                   |
|-------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Navy Blue         | `#05445E`  | Represents the deep ocean and builds trust    |
| Blue Grotto       | `#189AB4`  | Suggests waves and a sense of freshness       |
| Baby Blue         | `#D4F1F4`  | Offers a clean, crisp, airy feel              |
| Amber             | `#F7CB2D`  | Adds a warm contrast like sunshine or sand    |
| Teal (Secondary)  | `#00B2A9`  | Used for accents and surf-inspired energy     |

## Typography

The **SurfsUp** project uses two free and widely accessible Google Fonts: **Orelega One** and **Inter**. These were selected to reflect the tone ‚Äî fun, light, and modern ‚Äî while ensuring readability and accessibility.
